Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The Gaming Room desired to create a game called Draw it or Lose it where players from multiple platforms and devices could play together online.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  I felt like I detailed the recommendations section with clarity and detail. I suggested using a cloud platform such as AWS or Azure to allow for easier storage and expansion. I highlighted the benefits of using Linux as the operating system as well as its compatibility with other operating systems. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  I found that working through a design document allowed me to visualize the finished product instead of viewing it line by line. Using a design document allows you to strategize and find the most effective way to manage something rather than simply creating on the fly from scratch.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would have reworked my evaluations section. I added detail but I did not answer the questions given in a complete manner. I should have expanded the boxes given and added more details to fully answer the given questions.   

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  My design was to use cloud services to provide an added layer of security, storage, and ease of access. Operating the game via a web browser rather than an operating system-specific client download would allow better communication between devices and ease of use on the user side. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
Prior to this course, I would be given a task and simply create lines of code for the task to be completed. In the future, I will think about the overall project rather than the task. Looking at the overall architecture allows you to visualize how the project will flow, what are the weaknesses and strengths, and the compatibility with other systems.
